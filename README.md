 Scheduler Implementation <u> 

**Data Structures used**

Task Struct:  this struct has 3 fields: the priority of the task, its delay, and a pointer to the function name.

Queue struct: it has 3 fields: the current size, the maximum size, and a task struct pointer pointing to the array of tasks the queue has.

Typedef fptr: void function pointer.


**Main Functions**

Init(): initializes ready queue and delay queue to some default values. Current size is set to 0 and max size is set to a specified value. Also priorities of tasks are set to -1 and delay is set to a very high value. Also, pointers to the tasks are set to a dummy function that does not do anything.

QueTask(): this function receives 2 arguments: the priority of the task and a pointer to the function that implements the tasks. It then increments the current size of the ready queue by 1 and sorts all the existing tasks in the queue according to their priorities. 

Insertintodelay(): this function receives 3 arguments: pointer to the task, delay and priority. It then increments the current size of the delay queue and sorts the existing tasks in the delay queue according to their delay (the higher the delay, the lower its priority). 

ReRun(): this function takes 1 argument which is the delay. If it is zero, then function is enqueued to the ready queue. If it is non-zero, it calls insertintodelay function.

Dispatch(): this function takes no arguments. It dequeues the first task in the ready queue after checking that the current size is greater than 0. It then checks the delay queue and if its size is not 0, then it proceeds to decrement the delays of all the existing tasks in the delay queue. Afterwards, it checks if the first task in the queue has a delay of 0, and enqueues it in the ready queue if it is.

DelayMs() : simulates 50 ms ticks

**Scheduler unit tests**

**1st testcase: **
T1-> Priority 1 and ReRun(0), T2->Priority 3 and ReRun(1) and T3->Priority 2 and ReRun(2)

**2nd testcase:** 
T1->priority 3 and rerun(2) , T2-> priority 2 and rerun(1), and T3->priority 1 and rerun(0)

**3rd testcase: **
T1->priority 1 and rerun(1) , T2->priority 2 and rerun(2) , and T3->priority 3 and rerun(3)

**Systick Configurations**:
--HAL_SYSTICK_Config(HAL_RCC_GetHCLKFreq()*0.05); <br />
--HAL_SYSTICK_CLKSourceConfig(SYSTICK_CLKSOURCE_HCLK); <br />
-- HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, 0, 0); <br />

The 0.05 in the first line is what makes the Systick generate interrupt every 50 ms (1 tick).


**1st application (Temperature sensor)**: In order to implement this application, we had 3 tasks. The first task is Read_Temperature() which reads the current temperature from the sensor every 30 seconds and this is given the highest priority. This function is given a ReRunMe(600) since every tick is 50 ms so we need 600 ticks to read every 30 seconds. The second task is Compare_Threshold() and this compares the measured temperature with a certain threshold provided over the UART and this is given the second highest priority. If the temperature exceeds the threshold, it sets a flag to true. This function also is given a ReRunMe(600) since every tick is 50 ms so we need 600 ticks to check the threshold every 30 seconds. The third task is Toggle_LED() and this is the lowest priority. This checks if the flag is true, then a LED is toggled. This is given a ReRunMe(1) as we need the toggling to keep happening every tick if flag is true or stay turned off if the flag is false.

CubeMX Configurations for 1st application
SYS: Debug -> Serial Wire <br />
RCC: LSE-> Crystal/Ceramic Resonator <br />
UART-> UART1 enabled and set to Asynchronous <br />
I2C-> enabled (set to I2C) <br />
NVIC-> Preemption priority of UART1 handler set to 7 and enabled.

How to run the application: Generate code using the above configurations. Then in the main.c, put the code provided in the ProjectApp1/Src/main.c and in the stm32l4xx_it.c, put the code provided in ProjectApp1/Src/stm32l4xx_it.c. Connections are made like in the video and open Teraterm and change the baud rate to 115200 and type the threshold and press enter and wait for toggling if the read temperature (also displayed on TeraTerm) is higher than the threshold. 



**2nd application(Parking Sensor)**: In order to implement this function, we used 3 tasks. The first is ReadDistance() which reads the current distance of the object from the sensor and compares the distance read to certain thresholds and sets frequencies accordingly. This is given the highest priority. The second task is ToggleAlarm() and this toggles the buzzer based on the frequencies set in the first task. It is given a rerun dependent on the frequency. The third task is WaitForEachTick() and this is given rerunme of 0 to allow for toggling each tick depending on the distance 

CubeMX Configurations for 2nd application:
TIM1: Clock Source->Internal clock <br />
Channel1-> input capture direct mode <br />
NVIC-> enable tim1 global interrupt <br />
Set PB3 as GPIO_Output <br />

How to run the application: Generate code using the above configurations. Then in the main.c, put the code provided in the /Project1App2_2/Src/main.c and in the stm32l4xx_it.c, put the code provided in /Project1App2_2/Src/stm32l4xx_it.c. Also, the "hcSR04.h" and "hcSR04.c" need to be added to the project. Connections are made like in the video and have an object at a distance from the sensor and keep making it close and you will listen to the buzzer buzzing at a higher frequency.
